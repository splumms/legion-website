        "description": "We have been out of our building since Covid began March 2020 due to Covid Health Restrictions and now renovations. We have completed Phase One which included raising the building 12 inches, replacing the foundation, installing a new drainage system and installing an elevator shaft. We are currently constructing two new upper level additions, one in the front and one in the rear, a new roof, a mechanical room at the rear and a completely renovated basement to include a new ramp, power entry door, 2 accessible washrooms, an accessible bar and 6 accessible dart boards. Before we complete this phase and continue into the last phase we need your help if we are to sustain a viable long-term facility where we can maintain our mission and provide a safe place for all members of our community. To date we have received and used Government Grants, our own Branch 74 money, donations from a few members, demolition pro-bono labour from our members, pro-bono assistance from many companies and a variety of construction material from several companies. We now need your help!",
